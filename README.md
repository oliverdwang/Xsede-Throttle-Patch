# Xsede-Throttle-Patch
Xsede is a simple Powershell script that automatically applies XTU settings. By repeatedly resetting the tuning values, this program can block the Embedded Controller in the computer from resetting the values back to default manufacturer settings. The desired settings, including setting update rate, short boost power, long boost power, and boost duration, can be manually editted and customized for both battery mode and for AC mode. The switching between battery mode and AC mode is automatically done at the launch of the script, which can be executed using the windows task scheduler.
### Warning: This program is experimental and still incomplete. Use at your own risk.
